# Kaylor-et-al-2025-MovementEcology

This repository contains the data associated with Kaylor et al. 2025 published in Movement Ecology (doi: 10.1186/s40462-024-00524-3): “Watershed-scale dispersal patterns of juvenile Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) revealed through genetic parentage analysis”.

The repository contains 4 csv data files and an additional csv file with descriptions of metrics associated with column names in each file. 

“Kaylor et al_MovementEcology_2020 adult data” contains sampling details and locations of post-spawn female carcasses. The unique ID for each female (genid_adult) is used to link individual parr to their maternal parent and associated location. 

“Kaylor et al_MovementEcology_2020 parr data” contains sampling details, locations, genetic assignments, and dispersal estimates of individual parr. The file contains all 3,338 sampled parr, of which 1,326 were paired to a female adult and used in analyses. 

“Kaylor et al_MovementEcology_2021 abundance estimates” contains snorkel and electrofishing survey details and abundance estimates for individual mainstem and tributary reaches. The file also contains abundance predictions for reaches that were not surveyed but used to predict watershed-scale abundance. 

“Kaylor et al_MovementEcology_2020-2021 daily temperature” contains daily temperature summaries from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 for 49 loggers distributed throughout the Middle Fork John Day River mainstem and tributaries. These data were used to predict emergence timing and calculate mean July maximum temperature across the watershed. 

“Kaylor et al_MovementEcology_metric descriptions” contains descriptions of all column headers for each of the 4 data files.
